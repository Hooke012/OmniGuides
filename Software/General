# Email Encryption (Disroot on Thunderbird with OpenPGP)

To use OpenPGP functionality in Thunderbird, you need to set a so-called personal key pair for your email address. You can do that in the End-to-End Encryption subsection of your account settings. If you have already used OpenPGP with other software, you need to import a backup copy of your existing key. Otherwise, you can create a new key.

≡ > Account Settings > select your account > End-to-End Encryption > Add Key…
If you already have a personal OpenPGP key pair from another software, choose Import an existing PGP key.
If you don't have a key yet, choose Create a New OpenPGP key.
After importing or creating it, while still in account settings, select the key you want to actively use with your email account.
Note that using OpenPGP has consequences as explained in the general introduction. It is important to make a backup of your key and store it in a secure location, separate from your regular computer.
